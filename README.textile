h2. Euruko Growl

Brings you all tweetc containing the term "euruko" to Growl for the ones of us
still using twitter through the web interface and not with some full flexed 
client.

h2. What do I need?

h3. Install gems

  sudo gem install twitter
  sudo gem install ruby-growl
  
h3. Setup Growl

Go to the System Preferences and accept incoming notifications. You can set a
password there, too. If you do so create a file called growl_pass.txt in the
same directory where the growl.rb lives in and fill it with your password - 
nothing else allowed here! No white-spaces or new lines... NOTHING!

h2. Usage

h3. Start

  ruby euruko_growl.rb start

h3. Stop

  ruby euruko_growl.rb stop
